When I built the backend of my application (API and database connection), I used the following Python libraries:

1. **Flask**: A lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. Often used to build web applications and APIs.

2. **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, making database access easier and more efficient.

3. **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It's used to connect a Python application with a PostgreSQL database.

4. **Flask-Migrate**: An extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

5. **Flask-RESTful**: An extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.

6. **Flask-Bcrypt**: Flask-Bcrypt is a Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities for an application.

7. **PyJWT**: A Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

For the frontend, I will be using React.js

1. **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single page applications.

2. **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It can be used it to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.

3. **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

4. **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular and accessible component library that provides building blocks, that can be used to build React applications.
