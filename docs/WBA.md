A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a valuable project management tool that breaks down the work to be done for a project into manageable tasks or chunks. It allows for more accurate estimation and assignment of time, cost and resources to each task. Here is a simple WBS for your crypto trading app:

1. **Project Setup (1 day)**
   - Set up the development environment
   - Install necessary libraries and dependencies
   - Initialize the git repository

2. **Database Setup (2 days)**
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Create tables as per the database schema
   - Test database connectivity and operations

3. **Backend Development (10 days)**
   - **User Management (3 days)**
     - Implement user registration, login, and authentication (JWT)
     - Implement user profile retrieval and update
     - Implement password reset functionality
   - **Coin Management (3 days)**
     - Implement adding, updating and deleting coins from the database
     - Implement simulating coin prices
   - **Portfolio Management (2 days)**
     - Implement functionality to buy and sell coins
     - Implement portfolio view (owned coins and their value)
   - **Transaction History (2 days)**
     - Implement recording of transactions
     - Implement transaction history view

4. **API Development (5 days)**
   - Implement API endpoints as per the API design
   - Test endpoints using Postman
   - Implement error handling and rate limiting

5. **Testing and Debugging (5 days)**
   - Write unit tests for backend logic
   - Debug and fix issues

6. **Deployment (2 days)**
   - Deploy the application to VPS
   - Test the deployed version

7. **Documentation (2 days)**
   - Write API documentation
   - Write user manual

This gives you an estimated total of around 27 days for the completion of the project. Remember, these are estimated durations and the actual time may vary based on the complexity of tasks, the tools and libraries used, the developer's familiarity with them, and other factors. It's important to update these estimates as you progress with your project and become more aware of the complexities involved.
